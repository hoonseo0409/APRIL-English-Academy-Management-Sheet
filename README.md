# APRIL-English-Academy-Management-Sheet
Made by Seo Hoon
This excel sheet is made by me when I worked in APRIL English academy. 
At the time of my work I had to classify students who did not submit a specific homework combination or who were absent from a particular class. 
This is because I had to ask them to take assignments or classes. 
Due to the large number of students, it took a lot of time to manually do these tasks. 
To make things work, I used Excel built-in functions to create this excel sheet that checks the students in a certain way if they meet certain conditions.
